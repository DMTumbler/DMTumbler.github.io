            <h2>From Cook to Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there, my name is Christian. I'm currently a Computer Science student at the Universidad del Sagrado
                Coraz√≥n. Believe it or not, before that I worked in the restaurant industry as a cook for almost 10 years.
                I dreamed of becoming a chef, but things got complicated fast when my mental and physical health started
                to get impacted by that pursuit. It turns out I wasn't willing to truly chase it, much less with the income
                I would make in my hometown as a chef.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's when I decided to chase something different. I have always been passionate about technology,
                and so I decided to pursue a career as a programmer instead. That's when I went back to school, and so
                here we are, almost 4 years after quitting the kitchen.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been a journey that has been incredibly rewarding. I've learned a lot about software development.
                I actually currently work as a software developer at a small software consulting company in Puerto Rico.
                It's been a pretty intense learning experience, and I'm excited to continue my journey.
